                <p>Last updated: January 28, 2026</p>
                <p>At Vontage, accessible from vontage.app, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors.
                    This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Vontage
                    and how we use it.</p>

                <h3>1. No Data Storage Policy</h3>
                <p>Vontage operates on a serverless architecture. We do not maintain a database of user profiles, links,
                    or personal information. All data generated by the user is encoded directly into the URL (Uniform
                    Resource Locator) hash parameters. This means your data resides solely within the link itself and is
                    not stored on our servers.</p>

                <h3>2. Log Files</h3>
                <p>Vontage follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit
                    websites. All hosting companies do this as a part of hosting services' analytics. The information
                    collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service
                    Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These
                    are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.</p>

                <h3>3. Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
                <p>Like any other website, Vontage uses 'cookies'. These cookies are used to store information including
                    visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The
                    information is used to optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page content based on
                    visitors' browser type and/or other information.</p>

                <h3>4. Google DoubleClick DART Cookie</h3>
                <p>Google is one of a third-party vendor on our site. It also uses cookies, known as DART cookies, to
                    serve ads to our site visitors based upon their visit to www.website.com and other sites on the
                    internet. However, visitors may choose to decline the use of DART cookies by visiting the Google ad
                    and content network Privacy Policy at the following URL – <a
                        href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads"
                        target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

                <h3>5. Third Party Privacy Policies</h3>
                <p>Vontage's Privacy Policy does not apply to other advertisers or websites. Thus, we are advising you
                    to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed
                    information. It may include their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain
                    options.</p>
